# AI-Powered-Predictive-Maintenance-System-for-Vehicles-with-Real-Time-Data-Visualization-and-Analysis
This project aims to implement an AI-driven predictive maintenance system for engines, focusing on using Gradient Boosting Models to predict engine conditions based on sensor data. The solution includes:

- Data analysis and feature engineering.
- A trained model saved as a .pkl file.
- A user-friendly interface using Streamlit to predict engine health.


# 1. Introduction
Predictive maintenance powered by AI-driven analytics is transforming industries by shifting from reactive to proactive maintenance strategies, particularly in the automotive sector. Volkswagen is at the forefront of leveraging this technology to enhance the reliability and performance of their vehicles. Through an intelligent maintenance ecosystem, Volkswagen integrates real-time sensor data, historical maintenance records, and external factors like weather and driving patterns to predict potential engine failures with high accuracy.

This system uses advanced machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting, to process large datasets and provide actionable insights. These predictions enable preemptive alerts for maintenance, optimize spare parts inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction by minimizing vehicle downtime and ensuring better safety and reliability. The system's continuous learning ability allows for improved predictions over time.

The implementation is divided into several phases: data integration, AI model development, testing with select OEMs, and full-scale rollout across networks. By adopting this AI-driven predictive maintenance model, Volkswagen aims to revolutionize vehicle management, providing enhanced maintenance solutions for better vehicle performance and customer experience.
